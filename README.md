# Dombro React Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate meant to be used as a demonstration of bleeding edge or a foundation for my next project.

## Current Features

- Typescript Type-strict
- Slim: All libraries carefully chosen and/or avoided to minimize bundle size
- Bundle analyzer: webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Routing: React Router v6
- Forms: react-hook-forms
- Scroll Position tracking and restoration on browser back/forward
- React Recoil state management
